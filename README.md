# webbot
A selenium bot in an infinite loop to visit a site and generate traffic

This is a bot I made to increase traffic to a site. Using Google Analytics, this will create a unique "visit" for every iteration of the loop.

Currently, this is an infinite while loop that will run until you kill the process.

All you need to do for this is clone and set the siteUrl and the siteHeader constants. 

## Bonus
There is a random string generator leftover from when I was manipulating cookies
